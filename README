# INSTALLATION / SETUP
# 
# 1. step: (obviously you have to download this code)
#
# 2. step: if not alread present on your system install 'python'
#
# 3. step: install needed pakages for python, here is the list, you need to get
#          the correct versions for your OS:
#           * pcapy, impacket
#             http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/pcapy.html
#             http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/impacket.html
#           * gtk, pygtk, pygobject and pycairo
#           * wmi, libdnet (for windows and optional but very recommended)
#             http://timgolden.me.uk/python/wmi/index.html
#             http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/, http://libdnet.googlecode.com/files/dnet-1.12.win32-py2.5.exe
#          (use 'python setup.py install' to install python modules from source)
#
# 4. step: open a terminal/shell and run the script you want with root or admin
#          privileges:
#           * linux: - run "su -c 'python pyurlsnooper-gtk.py'" to execute the
#                      GTK/GUI script with root permissions
#                    - run "su -c 'python pyurlsnooper.py'" to execute the
#                      console script with root permissions (not recommended)
#           * windows: - here you hvae to open command-line as administrator
#                        already to execute the script with admin permissions,
#                        then (or use "RunAs"):
#                      - run "python pyurlsnooper-gtk.py" for GTK/GUI script
#                      - run "python pyurlsnooper.py" for console script (not
#                        recommended)
#                      OR
#                      - right-click on the script and choose to run as admin
#
# 5. step: enjoy the results, or PLEASE report me any bugs or problems (if you
#          have no idea which network adapter to sniff, use 'any')
#
#
# ================================================================================
# ABOUT / INFO
# 
# Use either 'pyurlsnooper.py' which is a minimal terminal/shell script, that
# prints everything to shell as well as it logs to a file. Or use the script
# 'pyurlsnooper-gtk.py' which is a full GTK+/GNOME script with GUI and cross-
# platform compatible for linux/win/mac. (it is tested on linux and windows 
# only so far - but since Mac OS, BSD, ... are very similar to linux - python,
# pcapy and pygtk should be available on or portable to all of those OSes, so
# that should be no bigger problem!)
#
# If there is is any question or suggestion please contact me at sf.net, thanks!
